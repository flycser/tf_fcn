# Fully Convolutional Networks(FCNs)

These are implementations of some different Fully Convolutional Networks with Tensorflow. The FCN model was proposed in the paper
>Long, Jonathan, Evan Shelhamer, and Trevor Darrell. "Fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation." Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2015.

The original implementation of FCN model is at: <https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org>


# Details

Python: 3.6

Tensorflow: 1.8.0

Some other packages are required, including: **numpy**, **scipy**, **pillow**.

# Note

The code is still being developed ...
